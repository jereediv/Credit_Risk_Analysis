# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
Using a credit card dataset from LendingClub, we will use oversampling and undersampling to assess credit risk.

## Results:
Using the scikit-learn and imblearn libraries we were able to calculate the following precision and recall scores for 6 machine learning models:

- Using BalancedRandomForestClassifier from imblearn.ensemble:
	- Balanced accuracy score :  0.79
	- Imbalanced classification report :  

- Using EasyEnsembleClassifier from imblearn:
	- Balanced accuracy score :  0.92
	- Imbalanced classification report :   


	
Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
